This is a simple implementation of a Third person character controller in Godot Game Engine.

This project showcases the usage of BlendSpace2D and AnimationNode Transition to control the character's animations.

I also implemented in this project a Camera feature for zoom-in and zoom-out, as well as Camera collision detection using RayCast.

I updated the project and added an attack animation.

You can use this project and improve it according to your needs.
